# Step-By-Step Procedure
1. Create an empty array1 for numbers between 1 and 2
2. Create an empty array2 for point awarded
3. Create a function to populate empty array1 
4. Create a prompt function to get user prediction
5. Create a random number function to randomize the given array
6. Compare user prediction to random function value and give a truthy or falsy string literal
7. Create a function for stages that does a callback to update array after displaying next stage
8. write a function to update array if number function equals random value 
9. create a function to use new array to repeat 3 and 4 whenever it is updated.
